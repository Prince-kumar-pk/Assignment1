3. create a array and object in javascript and print it.
Array in javaScript :
<script>
const names = ["Prince", "Adarsh", "akash"];  // array 
console.log(names[0]);
</script>

as array is already a n object in javascript



but  we can create with another example for oblect  with key value pair

<script>
let person = {
  firstName : "John",
  lastName  : "Doe",
  age     : 50,
  eyeColor  : "blue"
};
console.log(person.firstName);
;
</script>


there is one another type that is object array using json 

<script>
      let arr = [{name: "Prince", rank: 1}, {name: "Grapes", rank: 2},
      {name: "Apple", rank: 3}];
      console.log( JSON.stringify(arr,
      null, 4);) ;
   </script>
