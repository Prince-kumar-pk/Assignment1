2. explain the feature of nodejs like non-blocking, synchronous, single threaded.

non-blocking->   Proceeds  the execution of the program instead of waiting for long I/O operations or  for any other operation  like the request from the server 


synchronous->  Synchronous code runs in sequence  
each operation musht have to wait for the previous operation to complete before executing  current operation

single threaded->  js is  single threaded because it has only one call stack
